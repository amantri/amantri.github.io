I am an electrical engineer turned software engineer ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupmantri/)). 

I enjoy discovering new and useful **signals** in existing **data**, and have built applications across many domains from medical imaging, mapping, geolocation, music, and abuse prevention.
